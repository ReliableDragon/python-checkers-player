# python-checkers-player
Plays checkers badly.

Uses tkinder for the graphics, and is a decent example of basic graphics.

Runs by making a random valid move with a random piece. Does not pay attention to the "must capture" rule. When a piece is kinged, instead of moving randomly, it moves towards the nearest enemy piece.

Intended as a demo for CS 100 at Howard.
